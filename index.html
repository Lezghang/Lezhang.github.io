            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Personal Profile</h2>
            <p>I started learning classical saxophone performance from a young age. After entering Berklee College of Music, I switched to Jazz. I mainly play the Alto sax, followed by the soprano, tenor, and baritone sax. I've participated in numerous recordings at school, including big band sessions, and have been involved in recording music in various styles such as Jazz, neo soul, and pop. I've also participated in the recording of scores for several movies and games.</p>
